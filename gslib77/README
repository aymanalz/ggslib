README file for DOSEXEC GSLIB 2.0        Last Revised: February 14, 1997


This directory contains the README file that you are currently reading
and a version of the GSLIB programs for an IBM PC.  Some notes:

o. They do require the use of the memory extending programs in the bin
   directory and may not run on your vintage PC.

o. The executables are in the bin directory together with the normal
   files in the GSLIB bin directory

o. The allowable dimensions have been reduced to 2-D X/Y models 150
   cells on a side and 10000 data.  These limits could, of course, be
   increased and the programs recompiled.
